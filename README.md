# Database-Essentials-Day-1-Lab

## Requirments
Create a single .sql script that does the following:
* Safely creates a database called `Lastname_Firstname_SSD_Ticketing` where the Lastname and Firstname are your own.
* Uses the newly created database to safely create a single table called `Venue` with the following columns: 
    * Id (GUID)
    * Name (VARCHAR)
    * City (VARCHAR)
    * State (VARCHAR) Use the full word for each state (example California)
    * Capacity (INT)
* Insert a record for each Venue that an NBA (National Basketball Association) team competes in. [Wikipedia - NBA Arenas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_National_Basketball_Association_arenas)
   * Use the Lakers capacity for the Staples Center and add the Inglewood Basketball and Entertainment Center noted below the map ;)
